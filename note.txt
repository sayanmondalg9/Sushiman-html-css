## CSS BEM -> BEM stands for Block, Element, Modifier, and it is a naming
convention or methodology used in CSS to create a modular and mintainable
codebase.

# Block -> It reffers a complete scope or a component like header, nav, hero,
footer, card etc. (sections)

# Element -> It acts as a specific part of a component, like header title,
header__button, hero__image, hero__content, card__text, card__button etc.

# Modifier -> It helps to add some specific styles to a specific element(s)
like button--primary, title--large, link--active etc.

# Block -> header, header-content, hero-content-info, about-us

# Element -> __image, __button, __title, every element name works like
nav-menu__links,
nav-menu__icon,
hero-content__title,
hero-content__button,
about-us__image,
about-us__button,

# Modifier -> __link--active, __button--primary, __title--large, modifier
gives a special function like `active`, variant `3` `5`, text `large`.
